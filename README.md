# Real Estate Data Pipeline

Welcome to the Real Estate Data Pipeline project! This pipeline is designed to aggregate, process, and visualize real estate data in real-time, utilizing cutting-edge technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, and Apache Superset. The entire pipeline is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive real estate data pipeline, capable of processing and visualizing real-time data. The goal is to provide insights into real estate trends by collecting data from various sources, processing it with Apache Spark, storing it in Cassandra, and visualizing the results with Apache Superset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Docker**: To run containers. [Installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating multiple containers. If you're using Linux or need to install it separately:

  ```bash
  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  docker-compose --version
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-pipeline.git
   cd real-estate-pipeline
   ```

2. Install Python requirements (if developing locally):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Setup

1. Initialize Airflow:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up airflow-init
   ```

2. Start the pipeline:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. Access the services:
   - Apache Superset: http://localhost:8088
   - Airflow Web UI: http://localhost:8080
   - Kafka Control Center: http://localhost:9021

4. Stop the pipeline:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Environment Variables

Customize the pipeline by modifying the environment variables in the `.env` file.

## Data Persistence

The project uses Docker volumes to ensure data persistence. Volumes are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Troubleshooting

View logs for each service:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f <service_name>
```

Example for Airflow logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f airflow
```
