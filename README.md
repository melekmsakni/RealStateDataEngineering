# Real Estate Data Pipeline

Welcome to the Real Estate Data Pipeline project! This pipeline is designed to aggregate, process, and visualize real estate data in real-time, utilizing cutting-edge technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, and Apache Superset. The entire pipeline is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive real estate data pipeline, capable of processing and visualizing real-time data. The goal is to provide insights into real estate trends by collecting data from various sources, processing it with Apache Spark, storing it in Cassandra, and visualizing the results with Apache Superset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Docker**: To run containers. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating multiple containers. If you're using Linux or need to install it separately, follow these steps:

  ```bash
  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  docker-compose --version
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-pipeline.git
cd real-estate-pipeline
Install Python Requirements
If you plan to develop or customize the project locally, install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Setup
Initialize and Run the Pipeline
Before running the pipeline, initialize Airflow:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up airflow-init
After Airflow is initialized, you can start the entire pipeline with:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build -d
This command will build and start all the services in detached mode.

Accessing the Services
Once the pipeline is running, you can access the services through the following URLs:

Apache Superset: http://localhost:8088
Airflow Web UI: http://localhost:8080
Kafka Control Center: http://localhost:9021
Stopping the Pipeline
To stop the pipeline, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
This command will stop and remove all containers, but your data will be preserved.

Environment Variables
You can customize the pipeline by modifying the environment variables in the .env file. This file includes configurations for Kafka, Airflow, Spark, and more.

Data Persistence
The project uses Docker volumes to ensure that your data is not lost when containers are stopped. The volumes are defined in the docker-compose.yml file and are automatically created when you start the pipeline.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, you can view logs for each service:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f <service_name>
For example, to view Airflow logs:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f airflow
